## Array Drills

Dr. Dre needs some help with his banking. Below is a list of his most recent transactions (deposits are positive and withdrawals are negative):

`transactions = [50_000, -2_000, -25_000, 4_000, -12_000, 5_000, -800, -900, 43_000, -30_000, 15_000, 62_000, -50_000, 42_000]`

(Note: an `_` can be used like a comma when separating large numbers by three digits)

Write Ruby code to find out the answers to the following questions:

* What is the value of the first transaction?
* What is the value of the second transaction?
* What is the value of the fourth transaction?
* What is the value of the last transaction?
* What is the value of the second from last transaction?
* What is the value of the 5th from last transaction?
* What is the value of the transaction with index 5?
* How many transactions are there in total?
* How many positive transactions are there in total?
* How many negative transactions are there in total?
* What is the largest withdrawal?
* What is the largest deposit?
* What is the small withdrawal?
* What is the smallest deposit?
* What is the total value of all the transactions?
